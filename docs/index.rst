Welcome to Doma 3
=====================

Doma 3 is a database access framework for Java 11+.
Doma has some strong points:

* Verifies and generates source code at compile-time using annotation processing.
* Maps a database column to a user-defined Java object.
* Uses SQL-templates that is called two-way-SQL.
* Supports classes introduced in Java8, such as ``java.time.LocalDate``,  ``java.util.Optional`` and ``java.util.stream.Stream``.
* Has no dependence on other libraries.

This document consists of following sections:

* `User Documentation`_
